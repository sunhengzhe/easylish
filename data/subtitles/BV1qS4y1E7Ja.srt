1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I'm Peppa Pig, this is my little brother George, this is Mummy Pig, and this is Daddy Pig.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Peppa Pig!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Bubbles!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Peppa and George are drinking orange juice.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 What noisy little piggies!

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 George, look at all the tiny bubbles!

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I can make bigger bubbles!

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 George wants to blow bubbles too.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Peppa, George, you really shouldn't play with your food!

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Sorry Daddy!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Peppa, if you like bubbles, why don't you play with your bubble mixture?

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Yes, my bubble mixture!

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 George, let's blow bubbles in the garden!

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 First, dip the stick in the mixture.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Then, take a big breath and blow.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Bubbles!

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 George, now it's your turn.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Dip the stick in the mixture.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Hold it up.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Take a big breath and blow.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 George is trying really hard, but he is running out of breath.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Achoo!

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 George, you didn't blow hard enough.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I know a way George can make bubbles.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Dip the stick in the mixture, then lift it up and wave it around.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Bubbles!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It's even better if you run along.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Wait for me!

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 George is having fun making bubbles.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And Peppa is having fun popping them.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I love bubbles!

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Oh dear, the bubble mixture is all used up.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Daddy! Mummy!

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 There's no more bubble mixture.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Mummy Pig, bring me a bucket, please.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yes, Daddy Pig.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Peppa, bring me some soap.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Yes, Daddy Pig.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 George, bring me my old tennis racket.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 A bucket, some soap, a tennis racket.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 What is Daddy Pig doing?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 First, I need some water.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Then the soap.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And now the tennis racket, please.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Thank you.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Now watch this.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Wow!

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Daddy Pig has made his own bubble mixture.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Come on, everyone.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Be careful, Daddy Pig. Don't slip and fall.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I'll be fine.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Are you okay, Daddy Pig?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Yes, I'm fine.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Wow!

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Daddy Pig has made the biggest bubble ever.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Oh dear, I've spilled all my bubble mixture.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now we can't make any more bubbles.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But we can play jumping in muddy puddles.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Look!

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Daddy Pig's bubble mixture has made a big muddy puddle.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Look!

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The bubble mixture has made the puddle all bubbly.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy bubbly puddles.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy bubbly puddles.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Peppa Pig.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Peppa Pig.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Peppa Pig.
