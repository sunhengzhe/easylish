1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,535
Oh.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,055
Dancing through springtime flowers and
rays of summer sun, catching wet

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,335
snowflakes on your
nose, running through autumn leaves that

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,720
flots from trees on high with our
love that is bigger than the sky.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,360
Guess how much I love you, guess how much
I love you, guess how much I love

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,055
you, guess Guess how much I love you.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,920
Guess how much I love you.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,920
Guess how much I love you.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,200
Guess how much I love you.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,455
So do you know what's Little
Yellow Quack really is?

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Not really.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,280
I just know he can't be a squirrel
because he doesn't have a pushy tail.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,200
And squirrels don't quack.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,880
Sorry, I haven't been much help.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,800
Hey, look.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,400
Is that her?
A lady bug?

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,120
Yes.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,360
Wow.
Where did you get it?

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,760
It just flew onto me over there,
and now it seems to want to stay.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,320
How pretty.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
Look how small it is.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,320
And it beautiful spots.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,680
You are so lucky, little nut brown hair,
for it to stay with you.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Yes, I am.
Goodbye.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,640
See you later.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
Wake.
Wake.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
Hello.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh, hi.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,800
Good morning, little gray squirrel.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,320
Rise and shine.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Why?

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,520
It's very early and very
comfy up here in my tray.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
Let me see.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,880
Help me up, little nut brown hair.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,480
It is comfy and wow.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,600
I can see everything from up here.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,240
My home's on top of the world.

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,320
That sounds amazing.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
I'd like to see that.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
What do you think?

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Isn't it great?

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,240
Aren't you scared living
at the top of a tree?

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Not a bit.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,640
I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,240
I wish we could all have
a really big A leaf.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
Maybe we can.

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,760
A really, really big leaf.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,760
Got it.
Yay.

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
It's huge.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Enormous.

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,520
Gigantic.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,200
I've never seen these leaves before.

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,840
I have, but I've forgotten all about them.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
And you helped me remember
letting up around here.

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
I did.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
So let's play.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
Come on.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm a grasshopper.

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,640
Watch me.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Did you see how high
that grasshopper jumped?

61
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,600
Almost as high as I can.

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,720
Is that you, little gray squirrel?

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Come out and play.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,920
We're trying to be brave.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,920
Little gray squirrel, are you there?
Boo.

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,055
You can't scare me.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,400
I'm much too brave.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,680
Hello, brave field mouse.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
And little nut brown hair.
Hello.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,840
That's a big pile of nuts.
Yes.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,920
Too many to carry up
the tree all by myself.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, I know.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,255
We could eat some for you,
so there'd be less to carry.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Thanks, but no, thanks.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,000
If only I could get them to
that first branch, I'd be okay.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,815
Oh, I know how to do it.

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
But how?
Together.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
Ready?

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
There you are.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
Thank you.

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,320
Last one.

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,080
Yay.

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,880
All done.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,520
Thanks, little fior, mouse.

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,320
And thank you, little notran
here, for your clever idea.

86
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Lucky, you are big and strong and brave
You're brave enough to carry me too.

87
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,920
Well, many little hands
do make light work.

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,495
See you later.

89
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,055
Bye.

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Who's there?

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,480
Is that you, little gray Whirl.

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,520
Surprise.

93
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,560
I thought it was you.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Come up here, little not brown hair.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,360
I want to show you something.

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,000
It's a bit high.

97
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
Let me help you up.

98
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Wow.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,440
The Meadow looks so
different from up here.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,440
And look, there are cherries up here, too.
Oh.

101
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh, look, a flowery field.

102
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,520
It's amazing what you
can see from up here.

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,080
I guess it is.

104
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm used to it because
I'm up high in the tree every day.

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,920
Hello, up there.

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,280
How about dropping some of
those cherries down to me?

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,680
Good idea.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
Here, Whoa.

109
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,520
Ha ha, got it.

110
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,095
Catch.
Catch.

111
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,255
Here.
Hold on.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,775
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, got it.

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,695
Hold on, slow, slow down.
Wait a minute.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,215
Oh, got it.

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Good catch, Bignard, brown hair.

116
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
Come back, you leaf.

117
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,880
Oh, what's going on?

118
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,400
Look at these lovely fresh acorns.

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,680
Another autumn treat.

120
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,440
Did that fall from the sky?

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,560
Hey.

122
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,160
Little gray squirrel, watch out.

123
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,680
Hello.

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,200
Oh, sorry.
Hello down there.

125
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,880
Good morning.
What are you up to?

126
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm collecting as many acorns as I can.

127
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,360
They're ripe now, which means
we Winter is coming very soon.

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Come and play in the leaves with us.

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm much too busy
collecting food for winter.

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,040
Autumn is the busiest time for squirrels.

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,800
Listen, that brown hair?

132
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes.

133
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
How do we make the most of the wind?

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Look.
I'll get it.

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,800
Let me Let's chase it again.

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,320
We can't get them high enough to chase.

137
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,400
I think I know who can.

138
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,520
Okay.

139
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,080
So you want me to throw these off my tree?

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,240
Yes, please, little gray squirrel.

141
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
From the very top.

142
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
All right.

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,600
Be ready when I get up there.

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,720
We will be.

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,760
When he climbs that high, it
makes my tummy go all wibbly.

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Don't worry.

147
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,960
Little gray squirrel is I'm afraid
for climbing up high in trees.

148
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,920
I know, but my tummy isn't
made for watching him.

149
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,735
Are you ready?
Ready.

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,000
Ready.

151
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
Set.
Set.

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,400
Are you sure you're ready?
Ready?

153
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,800
He's not going to let the
seeds go right away, is he?

154
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,960
He always likes to have a bit of fun.

155
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
Still ready.

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,520
And we're still set.

157
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,440
On the count of three.

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,880
One, two.

159
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
Oh, I forgot.

160
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,600
What comes after two?

161
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
Three.

162
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,680
See, you weren't ready.
