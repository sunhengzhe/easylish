1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,360
 Oh

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:14,200
 Dancing through springtime flowers and raisins on the sun catching what's the inflicts on your nose

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,040
 Running through autumn leaves that float from trees on high with our love that is bigger than the sky

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,540
 Guess how much I love you

5
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:35,540
 Guess how much I love you

6
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,020
 Guess how much I love you

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,300
 I Know you could use it to keep the sun off you. Oh

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,580
 It's perfect now you can go out in the hot sun

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,620
 It does keep the sun off, but it is hard to keep on my head

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,180
 especially when I do this

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,160
 Thank you, it's the finest but it's not something that I need right now

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,140
 Goodbye

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,340
 Goodbye

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,740
 Hello everyone, what will we do today? Let's roll through the long grass

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,940
 collection of pebbles what about chasing this one down?

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,900
 What do you think we should do little that brown hair

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,300
 Do about what what do you think we should do today?

18
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,520
 We could play with the ladybug. Oh

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,960
 But it might get very thirsty last night it drank a whole drop of rainwater rainwater

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,500
 That's it we could go and see if there are any new muddy paddles to slash in

21
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,480
 What do you think this one up brown hair would you like to do that?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,580
 Yes, but I'm not sure the ladybug would like it. I might just keep an eye on it and see you all later

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,580
 Don't be long this one up brown hair. All right, let's go and look for paddles. Let's go

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,140
 Oh, but here comes little redwood fox

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,300
 Want to play litter not brown hair?

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,540
 It's too hot to do anything little redwood fox

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,240
 That's a lovely cool breeze

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
 Hi

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,220
 I want to make a cool breeze too

30
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,340
 Can you feel anything like a cool breeze? No

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,100
 Try this leaf

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,920
 Hmm that works, but it's not quite the same as having a special tail that can keep you cool in summer

33
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:08,760
 My tail does something special in winter too want to see sure a cold day

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
 It keeps me snugly and

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,800
 See well that's really is a special tail

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,340
 Little bit

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,660
 Hello, are you cold little redwood fox?

38
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,000
 He he he no I'm showing little not brown hair the special things I can do with my tail

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,060
 Well, I have a special tail too. What's this?

40
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,460
 Fantastic your tail is perfect for chasing maybe I can chase my tail

41
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,220
 Oh, where is it hold on if I can just

42
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:50,960
 Oh

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:04:00,480
 Oh, that was a great really poorly. I wasn't trying to do a rolly poly little grey squirrel

44
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,660
 I was trying to chase my tail. Why would you want to catch your tail?

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,720
 Because it's fun

46
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,480
 We've been showing this one up brown hair the special things we can do without tail

47
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,760
 Whoa

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,240
 How about this for special

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,920
 Wow

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,380
 That is special

51
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,920
 My tail is very useful

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,400
 Mine too

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,740
 Sometimes I used it to say hello

54
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,680
 He he he I use my tail to say

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,320
 Boop

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,600
 Oh what's wrong with that brown hair?

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,020
 Oh I really wish I had a long tail that could do special things too

58
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,600
 Why don't we make you a long tail?

59
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,800
 Me with a long tail why not

60
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,840
 Yeah, a long tail for me

61
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,380
 Where did little film mask go?

62
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,140
 I've got it

63
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,460
 This piece of ivy will make you a lovely long tail

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
 It'll be just like mine

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,400
 What do you think?

66
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,940
 It's just like yours little film mask

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
 Chase it go on that will be fun

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,800
 Whoops

69
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,340
 It's a bit longer than your tail little film mask

70
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,480
 A little bit too long

71
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,380
 I know where to find a short to tell

72
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,660
 Come on let's go

73
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,560
 I'm short to tail

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,740
 I like the sound of that

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,380
 Boy for me

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
 This spot will make a wonderful tail

77
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,700
 Let's tie it on with the ivy

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,180
 Great idea

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
 Right about here

80
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
 It's perfect

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,820
 Oh thank you

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,100
 It's wonderful

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,980
 Go on try to switch it

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,100
 It's a nice tail

85
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,040
 But it doesn't switch very well

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,300
 It's a bit

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,020
 Flabby

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,640
 I think you need a soft-up bushy tail

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,800
 Soft-up and bushy

90
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 Like your tail?

91
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,640
 Yes

92
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
 We can make one with leaves

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,980
 Yes let's

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,940
 I know where to find just the right leaves

95
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
 Come on let's go

96
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
 Thank you

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,580
 Thank you

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,620
 Thank you

99
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,920
 Thank you

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
 There

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
 It really suits you

102
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,600
 Look at me

103
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,580
 I have a bushy tail

104
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
 Try to switch it

105
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,520
 It's a bit tickly

106
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,479
 Try to wrap it around yourself like this

107
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,040
 Oh no

108
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,500
 Thanks everyone but

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,900
 I'm not having much luck

110
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,620
 With finding a new tail

111
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,620
 We can't give up yet

112
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,580
 Let's have another look

113
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,340
 There must be something we can use for a special tail

114
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,600
 Oh look up

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,240
 Here

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,120
 I'll look down here

117
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,500
 I'll look up here

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,419
 I guess I can look in here

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,520
 Hello

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,460
 Here you are

121
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,860
 Big number and hair

122
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,740
 Look

123
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,420
 I found this

124
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,220
 This will be perfect

125
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,680
 Oh you have been busy

126
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,480
 But what are these for?

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,660
 For making me a long tail

128
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,560
 A long tail?

129
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,200
 Show him all the special things your long tails can do

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,900
 Little field mouse you first

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,140
 Okay

132
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,520
 That looks like fun little field mouse

133
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
 Look at my tail

134
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,860
 Oh very nice little redwood fox

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,120
 I can see your tail is very special too

136
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,380
 Thank you

137
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,280
 Hello being a brown hair

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,360
 And hello little grey squirrel

139
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,720
 What a great thing to be able to do

140
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,960
 I say what you mean

141
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,200
 Your friends have very special long tails

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,100
 But your tail is special too

143
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,040
 It is

144
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,580
 I don't say how

145
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,200
 It's too short

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,720
 Do you see that bush over there?

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,700
 Yes

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,440
 Little field mouse

149
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,200
 Would you mind running over there and waiting for a moment?

150
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,000
 Sure

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,460
 Where did she go?

152
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,480
 I can't see her

153
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
 We can't see her anymore

154
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,240
 Okay

155
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,180
 Maybe you could go and find her

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,980
 And ask her to come back now

157
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,760
 All right

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,620
 And then can we see how special my tail is?

159
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,140
 That's exactly what we'll do

160
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,200
 Little not brown hair is easy to see

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,920
 Because of his special white tail

162
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,760
 But we can't see little field mouse at all

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,940
 His tail always helps me find him

164
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,500
 You do have a special tail little not brown hair

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,440
 I do

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,700
 It's white

167
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,280
 And it's so easy to see

168
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,180
 Really?

169
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,980
 It's fantastic

170
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,920
 Haha

171
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,460
 Today

172
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,480
 Brown and crunchy

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,860
 A little creature

174
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,420
 Bigger brown hair

175
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,280
 He's having a snooze

176
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
 Hello little green

177
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,700
 Harry

178
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,640
 creature.

179
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,880
 Hello!

180
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,460
 Tada!

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
 It's me, little field mouse!

182
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,460
 And that's not a little green hairy creature.

183
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,640
 How do you know?

184
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,520
 It's not a creature because it doesn't have any legs.

185
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,900
 Some creatures don't have legs.

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,940
 Like worms.

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,160
 Well, it doesn't have eyes or a mouth either.

188
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,900
 I think it's a something, not a someone.

189
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,260
 It's a...

190
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,980
 You don't know either?

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,040
 No.

192
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,580
 If it's a something, then I wonder what it's for.

193
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,800
 There must be a reason it's here.

194
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,500
 Haha.

195
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,140
 Let's ask these are redwood flocks.

196
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
 Great idea!

197
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,080
 Looks lovely and scratchy.

198
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,840
 I think it might be a special thing.

199
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,640
 Little redwood flocks is used to scratch their backs.

200
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,020
 A back scratcher?

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,060
 Yes!

202
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,260
 Why don't we try it out?

203
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,220
 Like this?

204
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,340
 Haha.

205
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:39,480


206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,820
 That's good.

207
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,580
 Just up a bit.

208
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,300
 A little bit harder.

209
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,540
 Or it works!

210
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,880
 Oh, I wonder if it would work for little brown hairs.

211
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,360
 I don't think so.

212
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,020
 Is it really a back scratcher?

213
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,820
 Haha.

214
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,900
 I don't know, but can you keep doing it?

215
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,500
 I don't think it's a back scratcher at all.

216
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,100
 Yeah.

217
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,880
 Wow.

218
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,000
 I think it's for making little feel nice.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,360
 Tola!

220
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,660
 See how tall I am?

221
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,280
 Oh, it's very tickly on my feet.

222
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,260
 Haha.

223
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,320
 I'm going to find your little brown hair.

224
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:29,680


225
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,560
 Hmm?

226
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,720
 Where did she go?

227
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,720
 BOOM!

228
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,080
 Haha.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,180
 You keep finding me too quickly.

230
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,900
 Well, hide again.

231
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,320
 I like finding.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,120
 I like hiding.

233
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,180


234
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,480
 I'll start counting.

235
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,340
 One caterpillar.

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,500
 Oh, two caterpillars.

237
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,880
 Three caterpillars.

238
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,480
 Coming to find your little brown hair.

239
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,720
 Hmm.

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,360
 BOOM!

241
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,420
 Hmm?

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,780
 Hehe.

243
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,860
 BOOM!

244
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,620
 Uh-huh.

245
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,820
 Hello?

246
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,560
 What are you doing?

247
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,440
 Playing?

248
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,940
 A corn rolling.

249
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,020
 We roll an acorn to the tree.

250
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,740
 And whoever gets closest to the tree,

251
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,920
 is that actually touching it?

252
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,620
 Wings.

253
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,340
 Do you want to play?

254
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,500
 Yes, please.

255
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,360
 I'll be really good at this.

256
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,080
 I'll go first.

257
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,440
 Look at what I thought of the game.

258
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,440
 Okay.

259
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,460


260
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,700
 Ah.

261
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,240
 Ah.

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,700
 Yay!

263
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,040
 Oh, be fast.

264
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,760
 Okay.

265
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:03,920
 Yay!

266
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,760
 Ha-ha.

267
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,680
 Go away, go away.

268
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,580
 Little bit closer.

269
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,060
 Yes!

270
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,840
 Hehe.

271
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,260
 My turn.

272
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,140
 Hehe.

273
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,940
 Oh.

274
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,860
 Wow, that's the closest one yet.

275
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,460
 I've got the closest to the tree.

276
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,880
 I can get even closer.

277
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,920
 Ha-ha.

278
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,260
 Yay!

279
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,720
 I win.

280
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,800
 I win.

281
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,700
 I win.

282
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,100
 Oh.

283
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,400
 You're not supposed to knock our acorns out of the way.

284
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,220
 Yes, that's not fair.

285
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,640
 Yes, it is.

286
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,060
 Hold on, hold on.

287
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,680
 Why don't we play a different game?

288
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,620
 Like acorns stacking?

289
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,760
 Huh?

290
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,820
 We stack the acorns on top of each other.

291
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,960
 Good idea.

292
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,660
 That sounds fun.

293
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,160
 Let's give it a go.

294
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,280
 Hmm.

295
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,460
 Oh.

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,600
 I can only stack two acorns.

297
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,700
 Oh.

298
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400
 Me too.

299
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
 This is hard.

300
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,280
 I know.

301
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
 But I'm gonna use acorns.

302
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,780
 Oh, I got three.

303
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,100
 Wow.

304
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,160
 I'm going for four.

305
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,480
 Oh.

306
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,040
 You can do it, little fear of mouse.

307
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,820
 You can do it.

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
 Oh.

309
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:00,960
 No.

310
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,760
 Little redwood fox.

311
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,400
 You startled me.

312
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,980
 I didn't mean to.

313
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,800
 I just get very excited sometimes.

314
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,260
 It's all right.

315
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,200
 Never mind.

316
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,700
 Let's play a different game.

317
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,020
 Can it be with acorns?

318
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,560
 All right.

319
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 Let's play acorns growing.

320
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,380
 What?

321
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,120
 We just throw an acorn around?

322
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:29,960
 Yes.

323
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,760
 But you never know who is going to get the acorn next.

324
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,920
 Like this.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,720
 I get it.

326
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
 Oh, that sounds like a good game.

327
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,340
 We'll all have to be on our toes.

328
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
 Now spread out.

329
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,420
 Here is the acorn around its nose.

330
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,920
 Who gets it next?

331
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,640
 Nobody knows.

332
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,460
 Oh, yeah.

333
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,500
 I caught it.

334
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,000
 Whoa.

335
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
 Whoa.

336
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,200
 You almost strictly little fear of mouse.

337
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,940
 Got it again.

338
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,140


339
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,060
 Oh, my turn now.

340
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,560
 Oh.

341
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,020
 There's a redwood fox.

342
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,880
 Oh, that's not how you play the game.

343
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,119
 I could never catch that.

344
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,500
 I'm sorry.

345
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,080
 It was a bit high.

346
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,060
 I got a bit carried away again.

347
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,860
 I'll go and get the acorn.

348
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,960
 It's no fun playing acorn games with little redwood fox.

349
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,300
 Because she gets too excited and ruins everything.

350
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,180
 Why don't we play without her?

351
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,840
 She's through that acorn a long way away.

352
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,920
 And you'll be away for quite some time.

353
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,440
 Okay.

354
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,260
 Oh.

355
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,900
 She.

356
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,240
 It's not right that we're not playing with little redwood fox.

357
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,100
 But we can't play with her.

358
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,860
 She gets too excited.

359
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,240
 That's just who she is.

360
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,480
 She can't help getting excited.

361
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,020
 Does this mean we can never play with her again?

362
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,400
 No.

363
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,740
 We just have to play the right sort of game.

364
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,500
 Oh.

365
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
 I'm sorry for playing roughly.

366
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,720
 When I get excited, I sometimes forget that I'm bigger and stronger than you.

367
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,000
 Oh.

368
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,380
 I'll try and think of you more when we're playing games.

369
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,140
 Thank you little redwood fox.

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
 We know you will.

371
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,500
 And we'll try to think of games that we can all play.

372
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,220
 Even very excited redwood foxes.

373
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,180
 But what kind of game would that be?

374
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,940
 I think I have an idea.

375
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,160
 This is a much better game.

376
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,800
 Three against one.

377
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,460
 Perfect for fox.

378
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,280
 He's bigger and stronger than us.

379
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
 Now catch.

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,040
 Whoa.
