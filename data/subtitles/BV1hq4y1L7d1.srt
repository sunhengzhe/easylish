00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey, Marcus. How's the job search going?

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,640
Not so great, actually. It's really frustrating.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,080
Why is that?

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,560
I've submitted my resume and applications to over 10 places, and I've only gotten one interview.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,740
That is rough. How did the interview go?

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,920
It was okay. I was nervous, and I think I spoke really fast.

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,900
Ultimately, they gave the job to someone with more experience.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,180
Well, don't worry. In life, you have to pass failure to meet up with success.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,920
Are there any other places hiring?

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,780
There are a few left on my list.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm still going to apply to as many jobs as possible, but there are a lot of other people looking for the same jobs.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,680
There's a lot of competition these days for jobs in business.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,980
I'll keep asking around to see if any of my other friends have openings in their companies.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,860
Thanks. I appreciate it.

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,240
Relax. You will find the right job at the right time.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,840
You speak two languages fluently.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,260
There are plenty of companies that have great jobs for people who are bilingual.

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,500
Yeah, that's a big plus.

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,980
Thanks. I appreciate the support.

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,700
How about you guys? How's your work going?

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,540
For me, this past year has been incredible.

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,540
I have the job of my dreams.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,380
The pay and perks they are offering are stupendous.

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,940
Perks like what?

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,600
Health insurance, free gym membership, paid time off, and company car.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I bet you are relishing every bit of it.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Yes, I am.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,260
Well, the only downside is that I have very little free time left.

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,760
My office work keeps me busy all the time.

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,020
I am working even on the weekends.

31
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,920
I guess you can't really have your cake and eat it too.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,180
Sometimes you have to make a few compromises.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
That's right, but I can't complain.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm fine with it.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,360
I love my job.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,180
How about you, Nate?

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,840
My work has become topsy-turvy these days.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,340
What exactly happened?

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,060
My boss is very demanding and not nice at all.

40
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,620
I have a lot on my plate these days.

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
I can understand.

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,760
You will sail through it like you always do.

43
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,540
I surely hope so.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,740
Hey, Maggie, guess what?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,580
I got a call about a job.

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,220
That's awesome, Marcus.

47
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,660
It's an accountant position, and I've got an interview tomorrow.

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
If I get the job, I'll be thrilled.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,500
It's exactly what I've been looking for.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,240
Okay, just try to look confident, and I'm sure you'll impress them.

51
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,900
Good luck.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
I hope you get the job.

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,660
Thanks.

54
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,680
Good morning, Marcus.

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm Julia.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,020
Good morning.

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,960
Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,120
I am the finance department manager.

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,900
As you know, there is an open position in our team as a financial accountant,

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,760
and I need to fill this position as soon as possible.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,280
This is an entry-level position, so we do not require a lot of experience.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,260
We are going to train the new person.

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,420
That sounds great.

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,660
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,920
I have a degree in finance, and I am fluent in English and Spanish.

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,920
I worked as a part-timer in college for a startup agency.

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
I translated financial documents for them.

68
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,840
How long did you work for them?

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,060
About two years.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,460
What are your strengths?

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,060
Why should we hire you?

72
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,000
Being a fresher, I think I'm very flexible and adaptive to learning new things.

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm a hard-working person and a fast learner,

74
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,320
and I get along fine with people.

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,620
I'm highly organized and respectful.

76
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,460
Do you mind working long hours?

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,080
No, I don't.

78
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,580
Can you handle pressure?

79
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,680
Yes, I can.

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,700
In college, I took quite a few courses each semester,

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,060
while working at least 20 hours every week.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,720
I handled that situation pretty well.

83
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,500
You sound really confident.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,280
It has been nice talking to you.

85
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,960
We'll get back to you in a few days if you get selected for the job.

86
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,600
Thank you.

87
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,060
It has been a great pleasure coming here and talking to you.

88
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,320
Hello, I'm Marcus Brown.

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,620
I was hired as part of the finance team.

90
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,080
Welcome, Marcus.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,680
We are so glad to have you working on our team.

92
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm Danielle.

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,860
I'll be training you for the next few days.

94
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,320
Did you find us okay?

95
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,600
Yes, I did.

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
I came by car.

97
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,640
But it was a bit of a problem parking the car on the street.

98
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,860
You should have parked your car in the office's car park.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,840
The entrance is at the back of the building.

100
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,280
I'll know next time.

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Let me show you to your desk.

102
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,460
Here you go.

103
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,260
This is where you will be working.

104
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,520
Looks nice.

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,640
And this guy right next to you is Drew.

106
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,380
He is the financial controller of our team.

107
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,520
Drew, this is Marcus.

108
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
He's joining our team.

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,620
Welcome, Marcus.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,220
We're glad to have you.

111
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,920
Thanks.

112
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,960
Pleased to meet you.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm excited to be here.

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,920
I'll take you now on a quick tour of the office.

115
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,940
Sounds good to me.

116
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,620
This is the break room.

117
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,380
We always have plenty of coffee and snacks available.

118
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,080
If you bring your lunch, you can put it in the fridge.

119
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,520
There's also a cafeteria on this floor where you can buy small snacks and drinks.

120
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,860
Where exactly is the cafeteria?

121
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,700
Just walk down the corridor in the front of us,

122
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,880
and at the end you'll find the cafeteria.

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,260
Oh, I see.

124
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,520
If you want a coffee, tea, can of Coke, or a bar of chocolate,

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,480
you can buy them on every floor from a vending machine.

126
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,040
When is break time, and how long does it last?

127
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,880
Break time lasts from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.

128
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,300
There is also a gym next to the cafeteria,

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,600
if you want to work out on your break.

130
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,620
I would love that very much.

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Here are the restrooms and the meeting rooms.

132
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,580
And over there is the CEO's office.

133
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,140
What is Mr. Easton like?

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,960
He's intimidating at first,

135
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,420
but he is really down to earth once you get to know him.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,580
He has high expectations of all of his employees,

137
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,140
but he supports us and helps us succeed.

138
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,500
Our last stop is to pick up any supplies you need from the supply closet.

139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,560
Who are those people over there?

140
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,740
Luciana is a newcomer just like you.

141
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,200
She's the one with long dark hair and blue dress.

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,680
And who's the guy talking on the phone?

143
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,920
Oh, you mean the one by the window?

144
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,080
In the blue shirt?

145
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,300
Ah, that's Ian.

146
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,200
He's the marketing director.

147
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,880
And that's Mike beside him.

148
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,040
He's responsible for the internal IT systems.

149
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,740
Okay, I'll try to remember all of this.

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,440
Don't worry about it.

151
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,980
For now, it's just good to put some faces to names.

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,580
We will have a team meeting at 9.30,

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,720
and I'll introduce you to everyone then.

154
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
This is the supply closet.

155
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,480
We have plenty of pens, pencils, staplers, notebooks, scissors, and more.

156
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,640
Whatever you need.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,520
You can grab a few things and take them to your desk.

158
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,100
I think I'm all set now.

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you.

160
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
Hi, guys.

161
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,400
How's it going?

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,020
Everything is great.

163
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,980
What's new with you?

164
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,740
I am very well.

165
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,140
You look very happy.

166
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,460
What's the good news?

167
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,620
I have found a job as a financial accountant at a multinational company.

168
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,380
That's fantastic.

169
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm so happy for you.

170
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,140
Way to go, man.

171
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,820
While I was searching for a job,

172
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220
I came upon this exciting new opportunity.

173
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,720
My team is so supportive.

174
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,000
I feel like everyone gets along well

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
and helps each other out whenever it's needed.

176
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,100
It's a really friendly environment.

177
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,720
Congratulations on your lucky break.

178
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,600
Thanks a lot.

179
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,120
So, when can we expect a big treat?

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,020
Whenever you say.

181
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,300
How about lunch at Falcon's Nest Restaurant on Sunday?

182
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,740
That sounds good.

183
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,820
I will see you on Sunday then.

184
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,880
Thanks for watching.

185
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,640
