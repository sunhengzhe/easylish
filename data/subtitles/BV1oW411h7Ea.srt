1
00:00:15,999.9999999999964 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm honored to be with you today for your
commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.

2
00:00:24,139.99999999999636 --> 00:00:25,420
Truth be told,

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,800
I never graduated from college and this is
the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

4
00:00:36,319.9999999999927 --> 00:00:39,280
Today I want to tell you three stories
from my life.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,220
That's it.

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,140
No big deal.

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,700
Just three stories.

8
00:00:44,19.999999999992724 --> 00:00:47,200
The first story is about connecting the
dots.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:56,440
I dropped out of Reed College after the
first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,920
So why'd I drop out?

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,200
It started before I was born.

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,500
My biological mother was a young unwed
graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:19,060
She felt very strongly that I should be
adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

14
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,780
Except that when I popped out they decided
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

15
00:01:25,960.0000000000146 --> 00:01:30,760
So my parents who were on a waiting list
got a call in the middle of the night asking,

16
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,740
we've got an unexpected baby boy.

17
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,780
Do you want him?

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,260
They said, of course.

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:46,600
My biological mother found out later that
my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,160
She refused to sign the final adoption
papers.

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,720
She only relented a few months later when
my parents promised that I would go to college.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,980
This was the start in my life.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:14,900
And 17 years later I did go to college but
I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford and all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,540
After six months I couldn't see the value
in it.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,620
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my
life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

26
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,160
And here I was spending all the money my
parents had saved their entire life.

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,940
So I decided to drop out and trust that it
would all work out okay.

28
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,580
It was pretty scary at the time but
looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

29
00:02:42,119.9999999999709 --> 00:02:51,680
The minute I dropped out I could stop
taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

30
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,300
It wasn't all romantic.

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,040
I didn't have a dorm room so I slept on
the floor in friends rooms.

32
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,300
I returned coat bottles for the five -cent
deposits to buy food with.

33
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,420
And I would walk the seven miles across
town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna Temple.

34
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,300
I loved it.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,920
And much of what I stumbled into by
following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

36
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,800
Let me give you one example.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,060
Read college at that time offered perhaps
the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

38
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,060
Throughout the campus every poster every
label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed.

39
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,840
Because I had dropped out and didn't have
to take the normal classes I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I learned about serif and sans serif
typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great.

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,200
It was beautiful historical artistically
subtle in a way that science can't capture and I found it fascinating.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,580
None of this had even a hope of any
practical application in my life.

43
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,320
But ten years later when we were designing
the first Mac and Tosh computer it all came back to me.

44
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,920
And we designed it all into the Mac.

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,899.9999999999709
It was the first computer with beautiful
typography.

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,020
If I had never dropped in on that single
course in college the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,280
And since Windows just copied the Mac it's
likely that no personal computer would have them.

48
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:45,920
If I had never dropped out I would have
never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,740
Of course it was impossible to connect the
dots looking forward when I was in college.

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,660
But it was very very clear looking
backwards ten years later.

51
00:04:55,440.0000000000582 --> 00:04:58,200
Again you can't connect the dots looking
forward.

52
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,440
You can only connect them looking
backwards.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,460
So you have to trust that the dots will
somehow connect in your future.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
You have to trust in something,

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,440
your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

56
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Because believing that the dots will
connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well -worn path.

57
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,500
And that will make all the difference.

58
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,220
My second story is about love and loss.

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,860
I was lucky.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
I found what I loved to do early in life.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
Was and I started Apple in my parents'
garage when I was 20.

62
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,640
We worked hard and in ten years Apple had
grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.

63
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,200
We just released our finest creation, the
Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned 30.

64
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,520
And then I got fired.

65
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,360
How can you get fired from a company you
started?

66
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,860
Well,

67
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,500
as Apple grew we hired someone who I
thought was very talented to run the company with me.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,840
And for the first year or so things went
well.

69
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,280
But then our visions of the future began
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

70
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,540
When we did our board of directors sided
with him.

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,680
And so at 30 I was out and very publicly
out.

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,480
What had been the focus of my entire adult
life was gone and it was devastating.

73
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I really didn't know what to do for a few
months.

74
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,380
I felt that I had let the previous
generation of entrepreneurs down that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,560
I met with David Packard and Bob Nois and
tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,980
I was a very public failure and I even
thought about running away from the valley.

77
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,940
But something slowly began to dawn on me.

78
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
I still loved what I did.

79
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,620
The turn of events at Apple had not
changed that one bit.

80
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,800
I'd been rejected but I was still in love.

81
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,700
And so I decided to start over.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,260
I didn't see it then but it turned out
that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,420
The heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

84
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,880
It freed me to enter one of the most
creative periods of my life.

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
During the next five years I started a
company named Next,

86
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,000
another company named Pixar,

87
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,080
and fell in love with an amazing woman who
would become my wife.

88
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,640
Pixar went on to create the world's first
computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

89
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,580
In a remarkable turn of events,

90
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,160
Apple bought Next and I returned to Apple
and the technology we developed at Next is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

91
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,680
And Lauren and I have a wonderful family
together.

92
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,580
I'm pretty sure none of this would have
happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

93
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,560
It was awful tasting medicine but I guess
the patient needed it.

94
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,680
Sometimes life, sometimes life's going to
hit you in the head with a brick.

95
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,240
Don't lose faith.

96
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm convinced that the only thing that
kept me going was that I loved what I did.

97
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,200
You've got to find what you love and that
is as true for work as it is for your lovers.

98
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,740
Your work is going to fill a large part of
your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

99
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,500
And the only way to do great work is to
love what you do.

100
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,940
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking
and don't settle.

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,880
As with all matters of the heart, you'll
know when you find it.

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,840.0000000000582
And like any great relationship, it just
gets better and better as the years roll on.

103
00:08:39,840.0000000000582 --> 00:08:42,559.9999999999418
So keep looking, don't settle.

104
00:08:52,420.0000000001164 --> 00:08:55,880
My third story is about death.

105
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,500
When I was 17, I read a quote that went
something like,

106
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,720
if you live each day as if it was your
last, someday you'll most certainly be right.

107
00:09:08,379.9999999998836 --> 00:09:10,300
It made an impression on me.

108
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,180
And since then, for the past 33 years,

109
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,340
I've looked in the mirror every morning
and asked myself, if today were the last day of my life, what I want to do, what I am about to do today.

110
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,380
And whenever the answer has been no for
too many days in a row,

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
I know I need to change something.

112
00:09:28,680.0000000001164 --> 00:09:35,020
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the
most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

113
00:09:35,680.0000000001164 --> 00:09:37,160
Because almost everything,

114
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,380
all external expectations, all pride, all
fear of embarrassment or failure,

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,540
these things just fall away in the face of
death,

116
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,040
leaving only what is truly important.

117
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,360
Remembering that you are going to die is
the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

118
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,420
You are already naked.

119
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,340
There is no reason not to follow your
heart.

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,940
About a year ago, I was diagnosed with
cancer.

121
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,480
I had a scan at 7.30

122
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,680
in the morning and it clearly showed a
tumor on my pancreas.

123
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,180
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

124
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:22,560
The doctors told me this was almost
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

125
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,720
My doctor advised me to go home and get my
affairs in order,

126
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,880
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

127
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,180
It means to try and tell your kids
everything.

128
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,780
You thought you'd have the next 10 years
to tell them in just a few months.

129
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,720
It means to make sure everything is
buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

130
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,060
It means to say your goodbyes.

131
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,140
I live with that diagnosis all day.

132
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,360
Later that evening, I had a biopsy where
they stuck an endoscope down my throat,

133
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,560
through my stomach and into my intestines,

134
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,360
put a needle into my pancreas and got a
few cells from the tumor.

135
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,100
I was sedated, but my wife who was there
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope,

136
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:16,040
the doctor started crying because it
turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

137
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,920
I had the surgery, and thankfully,

138
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm fine now.

139
00:11:28,40.000000000116415 --> 00:11:30,900
This was the closest I've been to facing
death,

140
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,960
and I hope it's the closest I get for a
few more decades.

141
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,060
Having lived through it, I can now say
this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.

142
00:11:43,280.0000000001164 --> 00:11:45,240
No one wants to die.

143
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,160
Even people who want to go to heaven don't
want to die to get there.

144
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,340
And yet, death is the destination we all
share.

145
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,520
No one has ever escaped it.

146
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,080
And that is, as it should be, because
death is very likely the single best invention of life.

147
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,300
It's life's change agent.

148
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,580
It clears out the old to make way for the
new.

149
00:12:07,380.0000000001164 --> 00:12:09,440
Right now, the new is you.

150
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,220
But someday, not too long from now, you
will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

151
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,400
Sorry to be so dramatic,

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,980
but it's quite true.

153
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,940
Your time is limited, so don't waste it
living someone else's life.

154
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,080
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living
with the results of other people's thinking.

155
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice.

156
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,780
And most important, have the courage to
follow your heart and intuition.

157
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,820
They somehow already know what you truly
want to become.

158
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,660
Everything else is secondary.

159
00:12:56,540.0000000001164 --> 00:12:58,340
When I was young,

160
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,340
there was an amazing publication called
The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.

161
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,260
It was created by a fellow named Stuart
Brand,

162
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
not far from here in Menlo Park,

163
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,940
and he brought it to life with his poetic
touch.

164
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,680
This was in the late 60s, before personal
computers and desktop publishing,

165
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,740
so it was all made with typewriters,
scissors, and Polaroid cameras.

166
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,920
It was sort of like Google in paperback
form 35 years before Google came along.

167
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,900
It was idealistic, overflowing with neat
tools and great notions.

168
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,340
Stuart and his team put out several issues
of The Whole Earth Catalog,

169
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,760
and then, when it had run its course,

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,460
they put out a final issue.

171
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,560
It was the mid -1970s, and I was your age.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,540
On the back cover of their final issue was
a photograph of an early morning country road,

173
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,500
the kind you might find yourself
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

174
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,380
Beneath it were the words, stay hungry,

175
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,760
stay foolish.

176
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,160
It was their farewell message as they
signed off.

177
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,020
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

178
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,220
And I have always wished that for myself.

179
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,080
And now, as you graduate to begin a new,

180
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,980
I wish that for you.

181
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,700
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

182
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,700
Thank you all very much.
