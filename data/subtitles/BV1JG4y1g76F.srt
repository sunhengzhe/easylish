1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,360
 Oh

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,200
 Dancing through springtime flowers and raisins on the sun catching what's the inflicts on your nose

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,080
 Running through autumn leaves that float from trees on high with our love that is bigger than the sky

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,880
 Guess I'm not try love you guess I'm not try love you guess how much I love you

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,440
 Guess I'm not try love you guess I'm not try love you guess how much I love you

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,960
 Guess how much I love you

 You who anybody home

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, right and shine. Sonny's on myself and the weather's fine

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,480
 Hmm, what's up good morning with your field mask? Oh

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,140
 Um, I mean field mice good morning

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,900
 Wow such a big family

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,180
 It must be snug and cozy inside your home

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,920
 Very snug and cozy. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,320
 Here comes another leaf

15
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,280
 It's coming straight to me

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,560
 Oh, it didn't get it never mind little field mouse. I'll send you an extra special one

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,900
 Something pretty something

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,500
 What about that blossom?

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,700
 Do you think little field mouse would like that?

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,400
 Perfect what's perfect? What?

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,960
 Just right there you'll see

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,240
 It's pink

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,699
 Thank you little brown hair. It's so pretty

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,720
 It's a blossom. I'm going to keep it forever and ever

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,160
 I'm winning

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,800
 Look at all the sparkling stars

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,780
 Yes, so many

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,400
 Look some of them make pictures that one looks like a twinkling carrot

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,800
 Yes, and over there a twinkling now

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,580
 Well there with a long shiny tail made of twinkling stars

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,800
 Come on, let's touch one

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,200
 Oh, yeah, we need to be higher

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,920
 Go up on your tiptoes this and that brown hair. I'm nearly there

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,560
 What are we looking for? Well, we're not exactly looking for it. Oh

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,860
 Well, smelling for it. What does it smell like? It smells fresh, sweet and pretty

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,800
 Oh, I know that smell. Yay! I wait for me

37
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:34,200
 Smell this blue flowery on that brown hair. Oh

38
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:38,440
 See sweet and pretty

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,980
 Am I right? You are right. It is sweet and pretty but

40
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,920
 But it's not exactly the smell we are searching for

41
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,280
 I'll take this one back so big nut brown hair can smell how lovely it is

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,580
 Okay, so what can we smell next? Oh little white flowers

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
 Oh, do you come and smell them?

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,640
 Hmm sweet and orangey and a little bit like the smell we're searching for but

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,839
 But not the exact one right

46
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,360
 For big nut brown hair

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,960
 He follows you everywhere everywhere

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,920
 He followed me all the way to visit you little film house

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,220
 Hello, what's your name?

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,680
 That's all he ever says. I think he's too young to talk

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,640
 Hmm do you know what he is? I know he isn't a hair

52
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,000
 Well, I think he's a oh, I know he's probably

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
 Oh

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,560
 Well, whatever he is he can't be a mouse because he doesn't have whiskers like me

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,580
 We can't call him whatever he is he needs a proper name. I know. I know we can call him little

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,860
 Yes

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,900
 Hello, uh-huh. I don't know

58
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:30,280
 Hmm you've got to have a name everyone does

59
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,520
 That's it what we'll call him little yellow quick. Yeah perfect

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,880
 What do you think of that little yellow crack

61
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,900
 He I think he likes it

62
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,580
 Around and around

63
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,460
 Open your eyes

64
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,500
 What do you say a orphan

65
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,620
 And she's singing

66
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,460
 I turn again around and around

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,620
 Can you see anything from down there?

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
 Yes

69
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,000
 Blue bird is making a nest. Oh, so she is

70
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,840
 That looks like fun if we had our nest we can play it together

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,340
 Why don't we build one it doesn't look that hard

72
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,060
 Yes, let's do it. I'll get some leaves and I'll go and find some twigs and sticks

73
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,060
 Oh

74
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,480
 Sorry little field mouse it's okay little nut brown hair

75
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,820
 Now what do we do?

76
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,640
 Hmm well, I suppose we put them together in some sort of nest shape

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,540
 I'll put this here and that's it and make it kind of roundish

78
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,280
 There our very own list

79
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
 Wait, I've got one leaf left

80
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,000
 Oh

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,520
 We didn't make it strong enough then let's try again

82
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,060
 There that should be stronger

83
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,120
 Yeah

84
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,260
 It's much stronger

85
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,840
 But it's still not quite strong enough then let's try again

86
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,580
 There do you think it's strong enough let's try

87
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,420
 Oh

88
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
 It is strong enough

89
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,620
 Hurray

90
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,100
 Well, what do you think of our nest? It's a bit

91
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,800
 itchy

92
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,080
 Yes the sticks and twigs are

93
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,440
 Very polky and prickly and scratchy and stickly

94
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,720
 We need to find something

95
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,840
 Soft to line the nest with

96
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,060
 To make it more comfortable I know just the thing

97
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:35,140
 A little bush

98
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,580
 Makes that nest even more prickly

99
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:43,220
 Not the prickly scissors or use a soft down

100
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,560
 Feel how soft it is like a feather

101
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,160
 I

102
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,940
 It tickles

103
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,960
 I told you it was soft like a feather

104
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
 This should stop our nest being so prickly and polky

105
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,120
 You're right our nest isn't prickly now it's

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,980
 tickling yes

107
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,720
 Can't use the nest

108
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,720
 Because of me

109
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,220
 All the time

110
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,239
 We've never get me playing done

111
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,599
 Little field mouse where are you

112
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,140


113
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,080
 There you are

114
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,520

115
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,020

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,580
 I think it just likes the flower

120
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,920
 It looks so sweet

121
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,660
 Thank you

122
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,700
 Bye bye

123

 That was very kind of them to say such nice things about me

124
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,600
 Well having a flower and a butterfly does make you very special really

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:51,380
 Let's make you special too me how by getting a flower and a butterfly for you too oh yes

126
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,500
 There are some beautiful flowers here

128
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,040
 Ah here butterflies come to the flower

129

 Shhh little nut brown hair you'll scare them away oops sorry

130
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,220

 Am I still enough perfectly

132
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,080
 Then why on to any butterflies come into the flower

133
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,180
 Maybe there aren't any butterflies around here

134
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,280
 Maybe they just don't like this kind of flower

135
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,160
 Hmm maybe I'm just not special I'm sure you are

136
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,320
 Hmm

137
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,540
 Oh ladybug

138
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,120
 Hmm

139
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,880
 It tickles

140
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:07,280
 I didn't do anything it just landed on me just like the butterfly landed on me

141
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,960
 Now it doesn't want to leave me alone

 Do you know what my favorite spring thing is the colors in winter everything is white and gray

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,850
 But in spring look around you how many different colors can you see

 Brown field mouse

154
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,830
 Little field mouse you startled me

155
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,230

 That's because I am on a very important hunt what for yummy berries that I was saving for breakfast

 A bush full of yummy blueberries

161
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,350
 Oh the berries I lost were red

162
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,450
 But these are still very delicious I ate some this morning with my family

163
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,930
 Why not have this for breakfast instead

164
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,530
 Thanks, but I want to special red berries

165
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:31,150

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,970
 Oh in that case I might just eat some more of these

167
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,670
 Just to see if they're still delicious

168
