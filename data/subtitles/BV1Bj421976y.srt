1
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,420
 Oh, what are you guys in for?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,720
 Bank robbery.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,060
 Drug trafficking.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,180
 What about you?

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,440
 Movie piracy.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,180
 Who was?

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,320
 People in show business work hard to make those movies.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,380
 My media stocks underperform because of people like you.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,620
 My brother lost his job as a grip on a movie set because of piracy.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,560
 He had to sell his jet ski.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,940
 A grip without a jet ski ain't no grip at all.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,280
 Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,060
 Oh, you're about to find out what we do to copyright infringers.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,940
 We do to copyright infringers.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,240
 And then threaten litigation against accused infringers.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,320
 And then threaten litigation against accused infringers.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,300
 We didn't infringe on anything.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,860
 We didn't infringe on anything.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,740
 People don't wanna hurt us like that.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,460
 In times like that you can put your ass down here.

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,460


22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,460


23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,840
 Why are you crafting a boss?

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:14,840


25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,140
 Leave me behind too!

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,760
 Get you crap!

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,980
 That's not what I'm going to do.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,040
 Woohoo!

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,980
 It's almost like having Dad here.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,380
 Only with less groundling when I go near his food.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,920
 I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,100
 Lousy Rat.

33
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,240
 Maybe the person that turned your father in

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 thought they were doing the right thing.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,160
 Homer just pirated a movie.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,160
 It's not the worst thing Dad ever did.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
 It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,440
 Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong.

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,260
 No matter what.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,140
 I don't know.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,500
 It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
 He created this wonderful experience for the whole town.

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,419
 I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.

44
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,660
 Hey!

45
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,860
 Hey!

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,880
 You got it!

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
 What are you doing out of prison?

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,480
 You have to go back and give yourself up.

49
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,120
 I can't go back to jail.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
 There's no shampoo.

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,380
 Just soap.

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,420
 Wait, I know one place in Springfield

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,080
 that doesn't care about internet piracy laws.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,160
 Thanks for taking us in.

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,680
 Our family always appreciates asylum.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,340
 Our family always appreciates asylum.

57
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,400
 Refugee seeking asylum.

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,360
 Refugee seeking asylum.

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,540
 He deserves asylum.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,260
 He deserves asylum.

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,100
 This country that is like being on Swedish soil.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,960
 You're a safe here as you would be in the Skata Skrapan.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,040
 Your country doesn't think a legal download in movies is wrong.

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,560
 The people at Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.

65
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,460
 How was that Matt's deal?

66
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,040
 Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves.

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,900
 Claiming all their hit movies have lost money.

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,200
 I spit on their bookkeeping.

69
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,360
 Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to Taken

70
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,240
 where the hangover guys get taken

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,420
 and the only ones that can rescue them is Fast and Furious?

72
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,180
 Man, I would love to pirate that.

73
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,220
 As would the proud people of Sweden.

74
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,240
 They found us.

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,620
 There's only one sure far away to get fugitives out of a foreign building.

76
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,040
 Blasting death metal.

77
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,600
 Respecting the law, respecting the law.

78
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,600
 The copyright law, copyright law.

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,420
 Copyright law.

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,240
 You like this?

81
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,080
 Swedes love death metal.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
 It reminds us of death.

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,480
 Damn those peace prize-giving fish smokers.

84
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,140
 I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.

85
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,320
 Consulate. Consulates are regional offices

86
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,079
 which serve the embassy in the capital.

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,940
 Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
 You're the greatest wipe in the world.

89
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,900
 It was me! I was the one who told the FBI!

90
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:37,900
 How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,680
 I was just trying to do the right thing.

92
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,080
 Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,620
 Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,980
 Which authorities?

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,940
 The FBI.

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,520
 Which authorities?

97
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,740
 The FBI.

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,740
 To import authority, airport authority,

99
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,160
 to import authority,

100
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,360
 airport authority,

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
 to...

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,180
 Have you forgotten what you promised that are wedding?

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,220
 To love and cherish, to aid in a bet?

104
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,840
 I never wanted to say funny vows.

105
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,020
 Well, you did! And they got laughs!

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,500
 Sell it, laughs!

107
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,360
 I didn't mean for this to happen, but you were stealing.

108
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,120
 All I ever had was you looking up for me.

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,960
 I got nothing now.

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:47,860
 I got nothing now.

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,040
 I got nothing now.

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,460
 I got nothing now.

113
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,020
 I got nothing now.

114
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,280
 I got nothing now.

115
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,940
 I got nothing now.

116
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,700
 All rise, the matter of the people versus Homer Simpson.

117
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,340
 The people call High-Want-Ultra-Predosa Judd Apatown.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,940
 Homer Simpson is an enemy of art.

119
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,340
 Art created by writers, directors,

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,740
 and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples.

121
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,560
 And not just the people who dream for a living,

122
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,500
 but the people who depend on us,

123
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,180
 the spin-class instructors,

124
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,840
 the personal rabbis, Seth Rogan.

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,640
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

126
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,540
 It's true, I need him.

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,600
 I saw a bootleg DVD of the 40-year-old virgin

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,900
 for sale at a car wash.

129
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,900
 They left off my director's commentary.

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,180
 It didn't even have a blooper reel!

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,020
 Homer Simpson, you have been found guilty

132
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,160
 of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,380
 The illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material.

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,500
 Well-faw distribution marketing schedule, I gave you...

135
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,540
 Well-faw distribution marketing schedule, I gave you...

136
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,560
 I just handled distribution.

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,680
 I just handled distribution.

138
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,060
 Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself?

139
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,000
 No.

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,740
 Oh, no, tell them you're side of the story!

141
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,720
 I know I heard you, but please, trust me now.

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,480
 It'll work!

143
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,120
 You know what, Judge Epitow?

144
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
 I do have something to say.

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,680
 These movie people may say I'm a pirate,

146
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,820
 but I'm just a man, a man who loved Hollywood too much.

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,360
 So I made my own rules,

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,100
 and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
 He doesn't sound like a villain.

150
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,440
 He sounds like a classic underdog.

151
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,280
 He's the unlikeliest of heroes!

152
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,840
 But where's the love story?

153
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,020
 At first, my wife didn't believe in me.

154
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,460
 Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,520
 But when time seemed darkest, one minute ago,

156
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,720
 she was there,

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,660
 and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.

158
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
 He's a downloading David versus a greedy Goliath!

159
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,680
 An Aaron Brockovich!

160
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,040
 But with more cleavage!

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,180
 Two, three, good lord!

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,780
 He's getting all four quadrants!

163
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,780
 One family against all odds took on the system,

164
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
 and lost.

165
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,480
 Mr. Simpson, I'd like to buy the rights to make a movie based on your true story.

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,880
 I'm attached to executive producer!

167
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
 Executive decision!

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,120
 Executive decision!

169
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,260
 Executive assistant!

170
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,940
 Executive assistant!

171
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,220
 Attached! Attached!

172
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,100
 One movie! We envision a trilogy!

173
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,460
 Wilson's family was to play your family.

174
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,419
 I'd be Jaden!

175
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,720
 I'm not Jaden!

176
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,820
 On behalf of Hollywood, we are dropping all charges.

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,180
 These people hate my dad.

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
 How can they make a movie about him?

179
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,080
 Hollywood may be run by big corporations trying to squash people,

180
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,320
 but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations trying to squash them,

181
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,220
 in winning.

182
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,820
 I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.

183
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,620
 Surprise!

184
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
 What the hell is all this?

185
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,620
 We're so excited about your movie that we're having a special screening.

186
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,120
 But the movie isn't in theaters till next week.

187
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,940
 We ripped a version off bootleg bait just like you taught us.

188
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
 It's still got time to go on it, but otherwise it's a clean copy.

189
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,080
 You're pirating my movie?

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
 Now how you are?

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
 Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths!

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,520
 But the movie is... it's about you pirating movies!

193
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,600
 Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.

194
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,180
 We live in the real world, where I have something called...

195
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,660
 Profit, Participation!

196
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,280
 That's negative, man.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
 Oh, me.

198
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,600
 Now, all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens.

199
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
 No bargain, Matt Nays.

200
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,680
 And tell your friends it was great!

201
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,960
 Why the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it?

202
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,220
 Homer the movie, where it's Ask Body Spray.

203
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,540
 And so should you!

204
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,680
 Don't ask! Do smell!

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,200
 Oh, my dear, we really think you should be.

206
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,900
 Up, up, up, up.

207
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,800
 Well, have we learned about that blindly supporting our husband?

208
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
 Ask Body Spray!

209
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,040
 The End

210
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,540
 But then when time seemed darkest, she was there.

211
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,280
 She gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,880
 On behalf of Hollywood, we're dropping all charges!

213
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,540
 Yeah!

214
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,220
 So what do you think, Lisa?

215
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,540
 Who are the good guys here?

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,980
 The media companies or the internet freedom guys?

217
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,080
 Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day,

218
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,900
 they're both trying to steal as much money as they can.

219
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,040
 So, everyone's a pirate?

220
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,640
 And the worst one of all is...

221
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,460
 Music
