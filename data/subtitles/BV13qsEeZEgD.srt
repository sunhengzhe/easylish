00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,700
Hello, welcome to Open Tierra.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,280.0000000000018
Today we're looking at Singapore,

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:28,300
a dynamic city -state known for its
impressive skyline cultural diversity and world -renowned attractions such as Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,080
Join us to find out more about Singapore's
geography,

6
00:00:32,659.9999999999964 --> 00:00:33,480
people, food,

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,700
and history.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,060
Singapore is an island city -state located
off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,740
With a total land area of only 719.1

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,960
km2 or 277 km2 it is one of the smallest
countries in the world.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,880
Yet Singapore is also one of the most
densely populated countries with over 5 million people living on the main island.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,300
Singapore consists of one main island and
over 60 smaller islands.

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,660
The main island is linked by bridges to
peninsula Malaysia in the north.

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,160
To the south lies Indonesia and the Riau
Islands.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,320
With limited land, Singapore has had to
maximize land usage through careful urban planning.

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,960
Singapore has little variation in terrain
due to its small size.

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,160
The terrain consists mostly of sedimentary
rock and granite.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,060
The main island has a number of low hills,

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,740
including Bukit Timah, one of the highest
points.

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,980
Singapore's coastline has dramatically
changed over the years through extensive land reclamation projects.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Several rivers flow from the center of the
island towards the coastlines.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,680
Due to rapid development,

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,380
most of Singapore's original mangrove
swamps and rainforests no longer exist.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,520
However,

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,500
efforts have been made to preserve the
country's remaining natural greenery.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,360
As one of the most densely populated
places on earth,

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,620
Singapore has creatively managed its
limited space through innovative urban planning.

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,300
High -rise residential complexes house
most of the population.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,240
The city is divided into broad regions,

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,820
such as the central business district,

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
renowned for its skyscrapers.

32
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Singapore is also known for its extensive
green urban spaces and nature reserves that seamlessly integrate with the metropolis.

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,240
The country is steadily reclaiming land
from the sea to expand the main island.

34
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:59,700
Singapore is one of the most densely
populated countries in the world, with a population of around 5.6

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,220
million according to the World Bank.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,240
According to the 2020 census,

37
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,760
the majority of Singaporeans are
ethnically Chinese at around 74% of the population.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,260
Next are Malays at 13.5

39
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,400
% followed by Indians at 9%.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,520
The remainder are mostly Eurasian and
other minority groups.

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,500
Singapore has four official languages,

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,760
English, Mandarin, Chinese,

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,780

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,540
English is the language for business and
government.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,580
Most Singaporeans are bilingual and speak
English, plus one other official language like Chinese,

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
Malay or Tamil.

47
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,680
The major religions practiced in Singapore
are Buddhism,

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,900
Christianity,

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,820
Islam,

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Taoism and Hinduism.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,780
Buddhism and Taoism are predominantly
followed by the Chinese population.

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Islam is practiced by the Malay community,
while most Indians adhere to Hinduism.

53
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,840
About 18% of Singaporeans identify as non
-religious.

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,779.9999999999709
Here are a few iconic dishes that every
visitor must try in Singapore.

55
00:04:17,660.0000000000291 --> 00:04:21,800
Hainanese chicken rice is considered
Singapore's national dish.

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,940
It consists of fragrant rice and boneless
chicken,

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,740
seasoned with ginger and soy sauce.

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,100
The chicken is poached to produce tender
meat and flavorful broth.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,380
It's often served with chili sauce on the
side.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,160
Laksa is a creamy, spicy coconut curry
noodle soup.

61

but the Katong style is popular in
Singapore.

63
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,940
It contains thick vermicelli,

64
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,680
shrimp,

65
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,680
fish cakes and boiled eggs in a rich
coconut broth with spices.

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,380
Laksa is a perfect comfort food for rainy
days.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,840

76
00:05:37,280.0000000000582 --> 00:05:40,380
Strategically located along major sea
trade routes,

77
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,500
Singapore has long served as an important
port and commercial centre in Southeast Asia.

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,580
The earliest known settlements in
Singapore date back to the 2nd century CE.

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:03,260
The island was located on trade routes
between India and China and was referred to as Temasek, meaning sea town in Javanese.

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,980
From the 14th to early 19th century,

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,640
Singapore was part of the Malaka Sultanate
and then the Johor Sultanate.

82
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,800
During this time, a small fishing village
emerged at the mouth of the Singapore River.

83
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
In 1819,

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,540
British statesmen Sir Thomas Stamford
Raffles established a British port on the island.

85
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,880
The port formally became a British colony
in 1824.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,420
Under British rules, Singapore grew into a
major hub for regional and international trade.

87
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,660
Immigrants from China, India and the Malay
Archipelago flocked to Singapore.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,260
Its population and economic importance
expanded enormously during the colonial era.

89
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,120
From 1942 to 1945,

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,660
Japan occupied Singapore during World War
II.

91
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,660
The British surrender marked their largest
military defeat.

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,840
During the occupation, Singapore was
renamed Sionan.

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,000
The Japanese occupation ended after the
war in 1945.

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,340
Singapore then briefly became part of the
British military administration before returning to colonial rule.

95
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,060
After the war,

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,880
Singapore progressively moved towards self
-governance.

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,940
The People's Action Party won the first
general election under full internal self -government in 1959.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,920
On August 9, 1965,

99
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,780
Singapore declared independence from
Britain and merged with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia.

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,540
However, due to political and economic
disputes,

101
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,280
Singapore left Malaysia and became fully
independent on August 9, 1965.

102
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:57,880
Under Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore rapidly industrialized and became a global financial hub.

103
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Strict laws and efficient government
supported economic development.

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,380
Today,

105
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,280
Singapore is one of the four Asian tigers,

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,680
a highly developed and high -income
country.

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,620

This covers some key events in Singapore's
transformative history.

111
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,560

the world's most prosperous nations.

113
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,919.9999999999418
Its strategic location,

114
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:44,480
stable government, skilled workforce and
pro -business policies have made Singapore a global commerce, finance and transport hub.

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,340
As of 2022,

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,000
its GDP is around $460 billion,

117
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
according to World Bank data.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
Since independence in 1965,

119
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,560
Singapore has transformed from a low
-income nation into a developed free market economy.

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,420
The government promoted foreign investment
and exports in the manufacturing and services sectors.

121
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,400
Singapore also focused on education to
develop a highly skilled workforce.

122
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,360
Strategic economic policies and efficient
governance have enabled Singapore's impressive economic growth over the decades.

123
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,640
Singapore excels in several key sectors,
including electronics,

transportation and logistics.

128
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,300
It is a leading world facilitating re
-exports.

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,920
Manufacturing, oil refining and business
services are also major contributors to its GDP.

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,920
Singapore aims to grow innovative
industries like biomedicine and digital technology.

131
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,380
Some of Singapore's competitive advantages
include its corruption -free business environment,

132
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,020
strategic location and transport
infrastructure,

133
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,800
minimal regulation and multilingual
workforce.

economies like China, India and Indonesia.

135
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,840
Intellectual property protection,

136
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,320
advanced digital connectivity and high
productivity further strengthen its economy.

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:40,320
Its strategic location along historic
trade routes and diverse immigrant population have contributed to Singapore's rich cultural landscape.

138
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,140
Each main ethnic group in Singapore has
its own unique culture.

139
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,880
Malay culture is rooted in traditions,

140
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,320
arts and poetry from Southeast Asia.

141
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,520

Chinese culture contributes to lunar new
year celebrations,

145
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,360
dialects, philosophical traditions and
architectural influences.

146
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,240
Yet Singaporean culture is also distinct
from the cultural practices of China,

147
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,200
India and Malaysia.

148
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,100
Performing arts have grown in popularity
in multi -cultural Singapore.

149
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,520
The Esplanade is its National Performing
Arts Centre.

150
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,640
Literature often explores Singaporean
society and identity through various languages.

151
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,160
Singapore's film industry produces popular
Singaporean films.

152
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,660
Media is closely monitored by the
government which also aims to preserve the four official languages.
