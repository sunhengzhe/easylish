00:00:12,800.0000000000036 --> 00:00:13,320
Hello!

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,100
What can I do for you?

3
00:00:16,260.0000000000018 --> 00:00:16,560
Hello!

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,040
I might buy some notebooks.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,620
What kind of notebooks would you like?

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,560
Composition or spiral?

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,360
I don't like spiral notebooks because the
spirals get all messed up.

8
00:00:29,279.99999999999636 --> 00:00:31,680
So I'd like two composition notebooks.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,420
Line notebooks or blank pages?

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,680
What do you prefer?

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,320
Line notebooks with margin please.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,840
What size do you need?

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,240
I need a five size.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,220
Okay, I have this one in good quality
paper and plus to cover.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,800
There are five dollars each.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,100
They look good.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,980
I'll take them.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,080
Okay, do you need anything else?

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,540
I would also like a set of blue gel
ballpoint pens, a pack of five pencils,

20
00:01:04,319.9999999999927 --> 00:01:09,600
a pack of printer paper, a set of washable
markers, and a pair of scissors.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,380
Can you please tell me how much is that
set of highlighters over there?

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,780
It's five dollars.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,180
It's not expensive, so I'll take that too.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,320
That'll be eighty five dollars.

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,260
There you go.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,840
Hello!

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,460
How may I help you, sir?

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm looking for a birthday present for my
wife.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
Can you recommend something?

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,560
I think a necklace would be a great choice
for such an occasion.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,240
That sounds like a very good idea.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
I would like something simple, nothing too
fancy.

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,560
How about these necklaces over here?

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,320
I don't think these would fit her style.

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,760
They're too sophisticated.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
Do you have more designs?

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,880
Yes, we have this gold necklace with the
circular pendant or this silver necklace with a little heart.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,280
Wow,

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,740
this is exactly what I'm looking for.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,900
How much is it?

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Well, it's usually priced at $199,

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,900
but you're lucky.

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,960
Today it's 20% off.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Wonderful.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,060
I'll take it.

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,040
And can you also recommend something for
my seven -year -old daughter?

47
00:02:34,260.0000000000291 --> 00:02:34,860
Sure.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,260
How about this headband?

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,200
It's $15.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
I think she would love it.

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll take it.

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,340
Okay, do you need anything else?

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
No, that's all.

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,660
Thank you.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Alright, I'll ring them up at the cash
register for you.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Excuse me.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,140
I'd like to try this blouse on.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,140
Can you show me where the feeding room is?

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,020
It's at the back, right next to the
dresses.

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,260
Please follow me.

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,520
Okay, thank you.

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,000
Does it fit you?

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,900
No, it's too large, actually.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,720
Do you have it in a smaller size?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,300
I need extra small.

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,060
I'll go check.

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,220
I'll be right back.

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,160
Here you are, extra small.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,980
Thank you.

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,560
Is this one okay?

71
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,380
Yes, it fits perfectly, and I love this
style.

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,140
It also matches a skirt up just bought.

73
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,260
How much is it?

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,200
It's $29.

75
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,920
That's quite an affordable price for such
a high -quality blouse.

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,660
Yes, it's a stylish blouse, made with
soft, lightweight material.

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
It's a great choice for the hot summer
days.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,440
We offer fashion and quality at the best
price.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,380
Can I pay by credit card?

80
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,700
Yes, of course.

81
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,740
Alison, I don't know what to wear at
Malone's party.

82
00:04:18,779.9999999999709 --> 00:04:23,060
It's going to be a house party, so I need
a cool casual outfit.

83
00:04:23,840.0000000000582 --> 00:04:25,520
It shouldn't be that difficult.

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,980
You have so many stylish and trendy
clothes.

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,200
But I don't know what to choose and how to
match them for the best look.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,920
I was thinking of wearing this blitted
skirt I bought last week.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
What do you think about it?

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,000
I think it's out of fashion, and it's too
long and large.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,540
It doesn't suit you.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,360
It makes you look uncool.

91
00:04:49,719.9999999999418 --> 00:04:51,120
I guess you're right.

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,780
Maybe it was a wrong choice.

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,840
What do you say about this high -waisted
jeans skirt?

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,020
It's actually very trendy, because high
-waist is in style now.

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,440
You think so?

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,240
Definitely.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
We can add this big buckle belt.

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,460
Okay.

99
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,040
What actually I put on?

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,540
Let's pair it with this cropped long
sleeve white top.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,860
It looks great.

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
I love this blouse because it features
that big sleeve trend.

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,640
This layered necklace pairs perfectly with
the top two.

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,300
What a wonderful idea.

105
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,300
It matches my new shoes.

106
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,880
You look smashing.

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,320
Hi.

108
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,780
I saw your shoe clearance sale add on the
flyer.

109
00:05:45,979.9999999999418 --> 00:05:48,480
Yeah, we're offering discounts on all our
shoes.

110
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,400
It's the best chance to buy your favorite
shoes at a low price.

111
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,960
What are you interested in buying?

112
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,460
I need some comfortable shoes for running,
which shoes would be most suitable.

113
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,840
In my opinion, these sneakers would be
best for your needs.

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,040
They're great for running lots of miles,
and they're very comfortable.

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,340
I like their design.

116
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,880
How much are these sneakers?

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,980
Their regular price is $150,

118
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,140
but they're on sale for 50% off right now.

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Wow, really?

120
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,900
Let me try them on.

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,040
Do you have a size 8?

122
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,180
Let me see.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,140
Here you are.

124
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,220
You can go for a walk around the store.

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,040
They're soft and comfortable.

126
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
They slide off and on easily.

127
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
They fit me well.

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,440
I'll buy them.

129
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,740
Great.

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,420
I'll pack them up for you and you can pay
at the cash register.

131
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you for your help.

132
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,360
You're very welcome.

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
Excuse me, but I've lost my glasses
somewhere in this store about an hour ago.

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,140
I came back to search for them, but
couldn't find them.

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,400
Can you help me?

136
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,640
Sure thing.

137
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,300
Where exactly do you think you left them?

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,340
I left them at the sunglasses counter.

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,580
I was trying on sunglasses.

140
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,480
That's why I took them off.

141
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,720
They have quite narrow lenses.

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
So, small lenses then.

143
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,820
Right and their rectangular shaped, not
round.

144
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,200
And are the frames thick or thin?

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,500
Oh, very thin.

146
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,460
And their color is black.

147
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,300
I hope someone turns them in because I
really need them.

148
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,980
So, there are glasses with thin black
frames and rectangular lenses.

149
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,980
And you last saw them at the sunglasses
counter.

150
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,520
That's right.

151
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,980
All right.

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,140
Leave me your phone number and I'll call
you if someone turns them in.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,420
Hello there.

154
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,700
How can I help you today?

155
00:08:10,640.0000000000582 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm looking to upgrade to a bigger car
today.

156
00:08:14,280.0000000000582 --> 00:08:18,000
My wife and I are expecting our third
child and we need a bit more space now.

157
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,820
I completely understand.

158
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,980
Are you thinking of a car or an SUV?

159
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,960
Or are you interested in a van?

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,540
I think we would like an SUV,

161
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,520
but one that isn't too big.

162
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,780
And we'd prefer something with decent gas
mileage.

163
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,280
We have a new hybrid SUV that might be
great for your family.

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,140
Take a look.

165
00:08:40,160.0000000000582 --> 00:08:42,360
Wow, this is really nice.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,320
It has leather interior, a backup camera,
video screens for the kids, and optional third -door seating.

167
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,960
Very nice.

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
How's the gas mileage?

169
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
It gets about 40 miles per gallon.

170
00:08:57,640.0000000001164 --> 00:08:58,620
That's incredible.

171
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,280
That's better than my current car.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,780
How much is it?

173
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,440
The price is $40,000.

174
00:09:06,400.0000000001164 --> 00:09:07,820
Would you like to try it out?

175
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,920
Definitely.

176
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's take it for a test drive.

177
00:09:19,560.0000000001164 --> 00:09:20,940
What do you think?

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,700
It was great.

179
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,820
A smooth ride and very comfortable.

180
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,020
We have some great financing deals going
on right now.

181
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,960
Sounds good to me.

182
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,420
Let's talk out the details.

183
00:09:35,40.000000000116415 --> 00:09:35,580
Awesome.

184
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,780
Let's head to my office.

185
00:09:44,140.00000000011642 --> 00:09:44,980
Good morning.

186
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,240
What can I do for you?

187
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,860
My car is making a weird noise.

188
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,720
Tell me about the noise.

189
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,340
Is it squeaking, rumbling, knocking?

190
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,640
It's more like a squeaking.

191
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,360
And when does it generally happen?

192
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,700
It tends to happen when I'm stopping.

193
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm going to take your car for a quick
diagnostic test to see if I can determine what is causing the sound.

194
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,340
Great.

195
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,160
Thanks.

196
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,500
It looks like you need new brakes.

197
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,400
The brake pads are worn down, so every
time you stop, the metal from the brakes cause a loud noise.

198
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,380
I can put new ones on today if you'd like.

199
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,000
That would be great.

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,820
Thank you.

201
00:10:34,579.9999999998836 --> 00:10:38,380
I also noticed that your oil needs changed
and your spark plugs need replacing.

202
00:10:39,900.0000000001164 --> 00:10:41,880
Would you like me to take care of those as
well?

203
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,260
I might as well fix everything while I'm
here.

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,940
I'll get everything running smoothly for
you.

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,760
And I'll even run it through the car wash
when I'm done.

206
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,300
Thank you so much.

207
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,960
It looks and sounds like a brand new car.

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,520
You're very welcome.

209
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,180
It smells delicious in here.

210
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,880
It sure does.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,260
It's making me hungry.

212
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,480
Good morning.

213
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Would you guys like to try one of our
famous cupcakes today?

214
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,280
That sounds amazing.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,480
But we are here to order a cake.

216
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,880
Wonderful.

217
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,380
What kind of cake will you be ordering?

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,600
Are you celebrating a special occasion?

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,420
We are.

220
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,460
It's our wedding cake.

221
00:11:38,680.0000000001164 --> 00:11:39,200
Congratulations.

222
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,940
That's so exciting.

223
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,860
We heard you make the best cakes in the
area, so we thought we would order it from you.

224
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,320
Well, thank you.

225
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
I appreciate it.

226
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,000
And I know you won't be disappointed.

227
00:11:54,60.000000000116415 --> 00:11:55,400
When is the big day?

228
00:11:56,680.0000000001164 --> 00:11:57,720
August 28th.

229
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,180
And how many people are you expecting?

230
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,060
We're inviting 100 people, but we assume
about 80 of them will actually attend.

231
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,760
Fantastic.

232
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,240
And do you have any flavors, you mind?

233
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,120
I love chocolate, and Alison loves
vanilla.

234
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,140
So we aren't sure what to order.

235
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,540
How about we do multiple layers?

236
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,000
Some can be chocolate, and some can be
vanilla.

237
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,500
I love that idea.

238
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Me too.

239
00:12:27,820.0000000001164 --> 00:12:29,640
Is buttercream icing okay?

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,560
Yes, we both love buttercream icing.

241
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,540
Perfect.

242
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Do you want to sample some cake just to
make sure you like it?

243
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,040
Yes, please.

244
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,780
That sounds like a great idea.

245
00:12:43,560.0000000001164 --> 00:12:44,520
Here you go.

246
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,640
One vanilla sample, and one chocolate
sample.

247
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
Oh my goodness.

248
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,760
This is delicious.

249
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,840
So good.

250
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,540
It melts in your mouth.

251
00:12:59,380.0000000001164 --> 00:13:00,180
Thank you.

252
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,000
So I guess this means you're good with
your choices?

253
00:13:04,260.0000000001164 --> 00:13:04,820
Definitely.

254
00:13:05,880.0000000001164 --> 00:13:07,360
And what about a design?

255
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,220
Do you have anything in mind?

256
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,120
We were thinking some pink roses,

257
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,300
pearls, and ribbons in the icing.

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Sounds great to me.

259
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,720
I drove a design and we can get the order
placed.

260
00:13:20,680.0000000001164 --> 00:13:21,500
Thank you.

261
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,380
You're welcome.
