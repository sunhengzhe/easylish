They're too sophisticated.

They slide off and on easily.

169
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,920
They're soft and comfortable. They slide off and on easily.

170
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,730
They fit me well.

Excuse me, but I've lost my glasses somewhere in the store about an hour ago.

181
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Excuse me, but I've lost my glasses somewhere in the store about an hour ago.

182

I came back to search for them, but couldn't find them.

183
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,920

Sure thing.

187

Where exactly do you think you left them?

188
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,920
Sure thing. Where exactly do you think you left them?

189
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,759
I left them at the sunglasses counter.

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,065
I was trying on sunglasses.

191
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,371
That's why I took them off.

192
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:20,919
I left them at the sunglasses counter. I was trying on sunglasses. That's why I took them off.

193
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,420
They have quite narrow lenses.

194
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,920
They have quite narrow lenses.

195
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
So, small lenses then.

196
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
So, small lenses then.

197
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,420
Right.

198
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,585
And they're rectangular shaped, not round.

199
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,920
Right. And they're rectangular shaped, not round.

200
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,420
And are the frames thick or thin?

201
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,920
And are the frames thick or thin?

202
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,806
Oh, very thin.

203
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:36,388
And their color is black.

204
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,920
Oh, very thin. And their color is black.

205
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,420
I hope someone turns them in because I really need them.

206
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,920

So, they're eyeglasses with thin black frames and rectangular lenses.

208
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,920
So, they're eyeglasses with thin black frames and rectangular lenses.

And you last saw them at the sunglasses counter.

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,920
And you last saw them at the sunglasses counter.

211
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
That's right.

212
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920

My wife and I are expecting our third child and we need a bit more space now.

223
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,920
My wife and I are expecting our third child and we need a bit more space now.

224
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,912
I completely understand.

225
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:21,400
Are you thinking of a car or an SUV?

226
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,920
I completely understand. Are you thinking of a car or an SUV?

227
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,420
Or are you interested in a van?

228
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,920
Or are you interested in a van?

229
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I think we would like an SUV, but one that isn't too big.

230
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I think we would like an SUV, but one that isn't too big.

231

And we'd prefer something with decent gas mileage.

It gets about 40 miles per gallon.

It gets about 40 miles per gallon.

246
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,606
That's incredible.

247
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,901
That's better than my current car.

248
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,920
That's incredible. That's better than my current car.

249
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
How much is it?

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920

A smooth ride and very comfortable.

263
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,920

Awesome. Let's head to my office.

272
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,751
Good morning.

273
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,850
What can I do for you?

274
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,920
Good morning. What can I do for you?

275
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
My car is making a weird noise.

276
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
My car is making a weird noise.

277
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,912
Tell me about the noise.

278
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:51,400
Is it squeaking, rumbling, knocking?

279
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,920
Tell me about the noise. Is it squeaking, rumbling, knocking?

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,420
It's more like a squeaking.

281
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,920
It's more like a squeaking.

282
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,420
And when does it generally happen?

283
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,920
And when does it generally happen?

284
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
It tends to happen when I'm stopping.

285
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
It tends to happen when I'm stopping.

286
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm going to take your car for a quick diagnostic test to see if I can determine what is causing the sound.

287

Great. Thanks.

291
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
It looks like you need new brakes.

292
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
It looks like you need new brakes.

293
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,420
The brake pads are worn down, so every time you stop, the metal from the brakes cause a loud noise.

294
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,920
The brake pads are worn down, so every time you stop, the metal from the brakes cause a loud noise.

That would be great. Thank you.

300
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I also noticed that your oil needs changed and your spark plugs need replacing.

301
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I also noticed that your oil needs changed and your spark plugs need replacing.

302
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,420
Would you like me to take care of those as well?

303
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,920

And I'll even run it through the car wash when I'm done.

309
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,920
And I'll even run it through the car wash when I'm done.

310
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,525
Thank you so much.

311
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,903

And how many people are you expecting?

351
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
And how many people are you expecting?

352
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,420
We're inviting 100 people, but we assume about 80 of them will actually attend.

353
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,920

361
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
How about we do multiple layers?

And what about a design?

395
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:07,406
Do you have anything in mind?

396
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:08,920
And what about a design? Do you have anything in mind?

397
